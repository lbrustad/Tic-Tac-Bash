# Tic Tac Bash

## About
Tic Tac Bash is Tic Tac Toe, but written in bash

## How to play
Simply just play it!

# Known bugs
* The game is basically just acting correctly on inputs so far, so it's not really attempting to avoid overwriting yet. I will fix that later.
* Every time X or O is written, there is popping up an error that I don't know why I can't get rid of, but when I know, all the bugs I know so far should be gone!
* Last one, but it's not really a bug, I haven't added "winner" or "looser" stuff yet, but I can't do it without fixing the first bug I've mentioned here!

# More info comming soon!
